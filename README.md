Canvas Football Game V 1.0 Date 1/5/18


# Game Summary
This is a simple HTML5 canvas game that I built for a class project to learn canvas.


You control 1 football player and attempt to score a touchdown against 7+ randomly moving opposing football players.

It supports both single and multiplayer modes.

After each round an additional defender is added to the field to increase difficulty. If you are tackled once the game ends. In multiplayer mode the last surviving player has the oppurtunity to play until they are tackled.

## Game Controls
The arrow keys allow you to control your character and the "A" and "S" keys allow you to use your "Juke" function (hop left or right).

# Technology
The game was built using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and Canvas
It does require the use of a keyboard so it is currently not playable on a mobile or tablet device.

It is recommended you play on the most up to date version of your preferred browser, but as a minimum you need to be on

* Internet Explorer 11 and Edge
* Chrome 50 and 51
* Safari 8 and 9
* Firefox 45 and 46

No installation is necessary.


# Additional Notes/Next Steps
• Future versions will support sound
• I would like to eventually have it store high scores like an arcade machine.
• All players have the option to pick between 3 character types, runningback, wide receiver, and safety, each of the 3 character types have different stats to create a different game play.
